''' Function which determines how the number of trailing zeroes.
Works by finding how many times the factorial is divisble by 5.
The amount of 5s is the amount of trailing zeroes

big 0 notation : 0 (3n^2)

def trailing_zero(factorial):

    count = 0
    while factorial > 0:
        factorial = factorial//5
        count = count + factorial


    return count
